# codebasics-resume-project-challenge-4
Hello Everyone,

I am very happy to share that I have just completed the resume project challenge no. 4 organized by codebasics. #codebasicsresumeprojectchallenge



In this challenge I were assume to be working in a imaginary company atliq hardwares as a Data Analyst and my task is to provide some insights on different problems which company is facing.



✅ Challenge : Provide Insights to Management in Consumer Goods Domain



✅ What is actually company needed is described below:

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.



✅ Task

✔ The company provided me a pdf containing 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.

✔My task is to run SQL Query to answer these 10 requests and make report. And then to prepare a presentation to show insights to top-level management.(ppt is added in this post Must See)



✅ My Experience/learning while working on this project

✔  I work on SQL project for first time and completed it successfully

the tools I used for this project are MYSQL WORKBENCH and used SQL to get the insights and then used MS EXCEL to visualize those insights that are generated from SQL. Visualization is necessary to convey a clear story.

✔ I know most of the concepts in SQL like joins, select, where, group by, order by, limit and many more. All of them are used in the 

this project and more advanced concepts like CTE and WINDOW FUNCTION  were also needed in this projects that I had learned so it was also a great learning opportunity for me as well.
